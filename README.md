- Task_01

  Given a number. Print “odd” if the number is odd and “even” if itʼs even.

  [SEE Solution](./oddOrEven.js)

- Task_02

  Given two variables, which are the angles of a triangle. Find the third angle of the triangle. (Sum of
  the angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees).

  [SEE Solution](./Angele.js).

- Task_03

  Given a positive integer. Bring the last digit of the number to the beginning. Print the new number. If
  the last digit of the inserted number is 0, number remains the same.

  [SEE Solution](./lastDigToFront.js).

- Task_04

  [SEE Solution](./multiply.js).

- Task_05

  Given three numbers. Sort them by the ascending order.

  [SEE Solution](./sortNum.js).

- Task_06

  Find the sign of product of three numbers without multiplication operator. Display the specified sign.

  [SEE Solution](./getSign.js).

- Task_07

  Insert a digit and a number. Check whether the digits contains in the number or not.

  [SEE Solution](./containOrNo.js).

- Task_08

  Enter a number. Reverse its first and last digits. Print the new number.

  [SEE Solution](./reverseDigits.js).

- Task_09

  Insert a number. Print ‘yesʼ if the number is prime, ‘noʼ otherwise.

  [SEE Solution](./isPrime.js).

- Task_10

  [SEE Solution](./lengthOfVal.js)

- Task_16

  Given an array of numbers and a number. Find the index of a first element which is equal to that number. If there is not such a number, that find the index of the first element which is the closest to it.

  [SEE Solution](./findIndByVal.js)

- Task_17

  [SEE Solution](./rmSymb.js)

- Task_18

  Given an array of a size smaller than 100. It consists of numbers from 0 to 99 in any order. Create a new array where each element from that array is placed under the index of its value. Start from the smallest value and end with the biggest one. If there are missing values, put in its places undefined.

  [SEE Solution](./createArr.js)

- Task_19

  Given an array consisting from the arrays of numbers (like a two-dimensional array). Find sum of each row and print them as an array.

  [SEE Solution](./sumNumOfArr.js)

- Task_20
